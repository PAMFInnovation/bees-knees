<body><h2>Select Your Coach</h2>
<p>It is very important for you to designate a coach to help you for the first week or so after you go home. Your coach does not need to be a medical professional – it can be a family member, your spouse or partner, or a friend – but he or she should be able to attend your pre-operative appointments and therapy sessions with you and learn how to help you care for yourself after your surgery.</p></body>
