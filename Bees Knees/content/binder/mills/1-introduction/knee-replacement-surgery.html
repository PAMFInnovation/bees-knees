    <h2>Knee Replacement Surgery</h2>
    <p>Knee replacements can ease pain from arthritis or injury, and restore function even to the most active people. But it&rsquo;s important to have realistic expectations. After you recover from surgery, you should be able to do the activities you could do before your joint replacement, with less pain. The surgery won&rsquo;t fix problems unrelated to joint pain.</p>
    <p>During the surgery, your doctor removes damaged cartilage at the ends of the femur and tibia bones, along with a little bit of the underlying bone. Then the surgeon inserts metal parts that recreate the surface of the joint. The parts are either cemented or pressed into the bone. Sometimes, but not always, the underside of the kneecap is cut and resurfaced with plastic. Lastly, the surgeon inserts a plastic spacer between the metal parts to create a smooth gliding surface.</p>

    <p>Joint replacement operations are successful and long-lasting for more than 90 percent of patients. Nevertheless, joint replacement is major surgery, and like any such procedure, carries risks and potential complications. Your surgeon will discuss these risks with you at your initial consultation.</p>
