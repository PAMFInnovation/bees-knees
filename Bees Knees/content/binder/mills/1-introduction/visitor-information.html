    <p><strong>Visitor Guidelines </strong></p>
    <p>Mills-Peninsula offers family-centered care. There are no limitations on visiting hours. Our private rooms accommodate one family member to sleep in the hospital overnight if the patient wishes. For adequate rest, however, we encourage patients to see family and friends in moderate numbers and for brief periods of time. Here are our guidelines to ensure uninterrupted patient care:</p>
    <p>&bull; Visitors may not smoke in patient rooms or anywhere in the hospital.</p>
    <p>&bull; Visitors must dress appropriately and wear shirts and shoes.</p>
    <p>&bull; Visitors may be asked to leave the room during tests or treatments or when a doctor, nurse or therapist needs to see the patient.</p>
    <p>&bull; Visitors should maintain a quiet environment and should be considerate of all patients.</p>
    <p>&bull; For your safety, please tell any person with a cold, sore throat, fever or other transmissible illness not to visit you.</p>
