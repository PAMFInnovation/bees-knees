    <h1>Before Surgery</h1>
    <h2><strong>Your Surgery Checklist </strong></h2>
    <p>Planning ahead ensures the best possible recovery. Check off the items on this list to make sure you&rsquo;re ready.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check with your surgeon: </strong>About the medicines you are taking now. You may need to stop taking non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and any drugs that contain aspirin, one week before surgery. Also tell your surgeon about any vitamins, supplements, herbs or over-the-counter medicines you take.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-admission testing appointment: </strong>Staff should contact you to set up pre-admission tests a few weeks before surgery. Call 650-696-5373 if you have not been contacted. For your pre-admission appointment be sure to have your health insurance information ready. A nurse will take your health history, answer your questions and explain what tests may be necessary before surgery. If you have an Advance Health Care Directive, bring a copy to the hospital for your record.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Register for Total Joint Replacement Class: </strong>All patients and their family/caregivers should attend this free, one-hour class to help you become well informed and have the best possible recovery and outcome from your surgery. Call 650-696-5804.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Get a dental exam: </strong>Have any needed dental work done before surgery. After your joint replacement, you will need to take antibiotics before getting any dental work.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Get the DMV application for a temporary disabled parking placard</strong>, and ask your doctor to sign it. Submit it, so you have the placard when you are discharged from the hospital.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arrange to have a friend, relative or home health care worker </strong>help you during the first few days/weeks at home. You will need help dressing, showering and making meals.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eat a healthy diet.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quit smoking: </strong>Speak with your doctor about quitting smoking, or call 800-662-8887.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start doing strengthening exercises (both legs): </strong>You&rsquo;ll recover faster if you are familiar with these special exercises (see pages 10 and 11): Ankle Pumps, Quad Sets, Heel Slides, Long Arc Quads, Knee Slides, Short Arc Quads and Straight Leg Raises.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Home Health Services: </strong>Your doctor may recommend home health services if you have medical needs. These are usually covered by insurance. However, attendant care to help you with meals, dressing, showers and transportation is NOT covered by insurance. You must pay for that type of care privately. Discuss whether you need in-home health care or attendant care with your case manager or doctor before you leave the hospital.</li>
    </ul>
