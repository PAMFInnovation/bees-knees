<body><h2><strong>The Night Before Surgery </strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confirm your transportation to and from the hospital. </strong>You may not go home alone in a taxi or on public transportation.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Do NOT eat or drink after midnight. </strong>You can eat a normal dinner earlier in the evening.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Shower with antiseptic sponges provided by your pre-admission nurse. </strong>Germs always live on your skin, but you want to reduce bacteria before surgery. Do not shave below the waist before surgery. This helps prevent infection at the site of surgery.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Brush your teeth as usual. </strong>Do not put dentures or partials back in your mouth after you have brushed.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Remove all jewelry, makeup and nail polish. </strong>Please leave jewelry and valuables at home.</li>
    </ul>
