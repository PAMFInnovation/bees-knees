    <h2><strong>Prepare Your Home Before Surgery </strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Before you go to the hospital, do your grocery shopping, prepare and freeze meals, and put cooking utensils where they are easy to reach. Make simple meals that will be ready for you when you get home.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Move furniture to make a clear path to your kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. Many patients use a walker or a cane after leaving the hospital. This means you need more room to move around your home.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove rugs so you do not trip.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>You need a firm chair that has <strong>armrests </strong>to use after surgery. You should not sit in a chair that rocks, rolls or swivels.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Place a non-skid bath mat in your tub or shower.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>For convenience, place items that you use every day at <strong>arm level </strong>(between your waist and shoulders). You want to avoid having to bend down or reach up too much.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Have extra pillows available for appropriate positioning.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Make plans for someone to help you with housework, laundry, pet care, and driving to appointments for several weeks after surgery.</li>
    </ul>
