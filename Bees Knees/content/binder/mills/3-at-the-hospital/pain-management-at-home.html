<body><h2><strong>Pain Management at Home</strong></h2>
    <p>Your doctor will prescribe pain medication for you to use at home. It is important to have good pain control during physical therapy to make sure you get the most out of the rehabilitative exercises. Your doctor may also prescribe a stool softener because some types of pain medication cause constipation.</p>
