<body><h2><strong>The Day You Go Home </strong></h2>
    <p>Discharge is typically at 11 a.m. The day of your discharge, the surgeon and the hospitalist doctor will come by for important health checks. Ask your doctor or nurse about:</p>
    <p>&bull; Any new medications you will be taking</p>
    <p>&bull; Warning signs for when to call your doctor</p>
    <p>&bull; Your follow-up care and post-op appointment with your doctor</p>
    <p>&bull; What kinds of activities are safe to do</p>
    <p>&bull; What you can do to help prevent infection at the surgical site</p>
    <p>&bull; <strong>NOTE: You may not go home alone in a taxi or on a bus. Arrange for someone to take you home and stay with you for a few days.</strong></p>
