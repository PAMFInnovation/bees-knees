    <p>&bull; Work with your nurses and therapists to keep your pain under control, so you can move around as much as possible.</p>
    <p>&bull; Spend time out of bed each day. With help from your nurses and therapists, get out of bed 2-3 times each day and walk for short distances or sit in a chair at the bedside.</p>
    <p>&bull; Change your position, cough, and take deep breaths every 2 hours in bed.</p>
    <p>&bull; Use the compression pumps in bed.</p>
    <p>&bull; Do your ankle pump exercises every hour in bed.</p>
    <p>&bull; Use the Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) machine if your doctor has ordered it.</p>
