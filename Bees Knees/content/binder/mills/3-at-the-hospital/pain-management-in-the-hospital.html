<body><h2><strong>Pain Management in the Hospital </strong></h2>
    <p>Pain is an individual experience. Our goal is to keep you as comfortable as possible after surgery. With proper pain management you will be able to move around and do your deep breathing exercises. Some patients worry they will become addicted to the pain medications. This should not be a concern as you will only take these medications for a short period of time.</p>
    <p>The pain measurement scale will help your nurse determine the effectiveness of the medication. You will be asked to describe your pain or discomfort level in a number (see scale below). There is no right or wrong answer. Adequate pain management is necessary and crucial for your recovery. Be sure to ask your nurse for medication <strong>before </strong>pain prevents you from actively participating in your recovery.</p>
