    <h2><strong>Recovering at Home </strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Call Your Doctor If: </strong></p>
    <p>&bull; You develop a fever</p>
    <p>&bull; You experience increased pain in your operated leg and if pain medication and rest do not relieve or reduce it</p>
    <p>&bull; The lower part of the operated leg or foot becomes swollen</p>
    <p>&bull; The color of your feet becomes pale or dusky</p>
    <p>&bull; Your feet become numb or cool</p>
    <p>&bull; You have difficulty moving your toes or ankles</p>
    <p>&bull; The incision becomes red, swollen or very painful or drainage increases</p>
    <p><strong>Activity </strong></p>
    <p>Be sure you have someone staying with you for the first few days at home. Start slow, and progress at a pace that feels comfortable to you. You may need to schedule times to rest during the day.</p>
    <p><strong>Weight Bearing: </strong>Your doctor or therapist will suggest when you may stop using medical equipment such as walkers or canes, as you feel steady and able.</p>
    <p><strong>Climbing Stairs: </strong>If you have stairs in your house, you will have practiced how to use them in the hospital. If you have concerns, talk with your physical therapist.</p>
    <p><strong>Driving: </strong>Your doctor will advise you, depending on your health and how quickly you are recovering. Most people can drive when the knee bends well enough so they can comfortably enter and sit in a car, and are off pain medications. Typically, this is four to eight weeks after surgery.</p>
    <p><strong>Sex: </strong>Ask your doctor. It will depend on your health and how well you are recovering.</p>
    <p><strong>Sitting: </strong>Sit in chairs that have arms for the first few months. Don&rsquo;t sit on low chairs or stools, or in recliners. Get up and walk around at least once every hour.</p>
    <p><strong>Returning to Work: </strong>Your doctor will advise you, depending on the type of work and activities you do, and your recovery.</p>
