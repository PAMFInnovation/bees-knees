    <h2><strong>Nutrition Tips for Recovery </strong></h2>
    <p>To speed your recovery, it&rsquo;s important to eat nutritious foods. Some people lose their appetite right after surgery and while taking pain medications. However, surgery increases the body&rsquo;s need for calories. You need more calories to heal.</p>
    <p>&bull; Eat <strong>smaller meals more often </strong>if you find that your appetite has decreased.</p>
    <p>&bull; For <strong>fiber</strong>, choose fruits, vegetables, cooked beans and whole grains. Fiber helps normal bowel movements.</p>
    <p>&bull; Plan to have <strong>protein </strong>at each meal. Protein is a very important building block for muscle and bone. It is found in meat, fish, eggs, poultry, nuts, dairy products, soy products and cooked dried beans.</p>
    <p>&bull; <strong>Calcium </strong>is an important element of bone health. Drink milk or calcium-fortified juices, and eat yogurt or cheese for calcium. Your doctor may recommend a calcium pill and vitamin D for you if you don&rsquo;t get enough from your food.</p>
    <p>&bull; <strong>Vitamin C </strong>helps the body heal wounds and form bone. Get vitamin C from citrus fruits, green and red peppers, collard greens, broccoli, spinach, strawberries, tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
    <p>&bull; Remember to drink plenty of <strong>water</strong>. To avoid constipation, you need to drink at least six to eight cups of fluid a day.</p>
