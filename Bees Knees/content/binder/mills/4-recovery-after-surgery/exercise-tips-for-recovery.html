    <h2><strong>Exercise Tips for Recovery </strong></h2>
    <p>Exercise is important for your general physical and mental health. The purpose of joint replacement surgery is to return you to an active and healthy lifestyle.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s crucial to do the prescribed exercises recommended by your physical therapist. This is one of the most important things you can do to speed your recovery.</p>
    <p>&bull; <strong>Walk </strong>as much as you like once your doctor says it&rsquo;s OK.</p>
    <p>&bull; <strong>Swimming </strong>is another very beneficial exercise. You can swim as soon as your wound has healed and you are cleared by your doctor. This is usually six to eight weeks after surgery.</p>
    <p>&bull; <strong>Golfing, dancing and bicycling </strong>on paved surfaces are OK to do with your doctor&rsquo;s permission.</p>
    <p>&bull; <strong>Avoid high-impact exercises </strong>such as running or contact sports. Talk to your doctor before you resume these activities.</p>
    <p>&bull; <strong>Avoid carrying heavy objects, </strong>especially up stairs or hills.</p>
