<h2>Air Travel and Metal Detectors</h2>
<p>Some implants may set off metal detectors. This may cause heightened screening measures for you at airports. Anticipate this possibility and allow extra time.<br /><br /> You may receive a card after surgery with pictures of your replacement and your knee x-ray. Typically this card or a note from your surgeon will not influence airport security screemng measures.</p>
