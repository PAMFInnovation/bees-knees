<h2>Rehabilitation</h2>
<p>It will take three to six months for your joint to heal. It may take up to a year to develop full motion and strength. For the first month or two you will be using a walker, crutches or a cane. Your exercise program is a vital part of recovery. How much strength and motion you regain depends on a large part to your level of commitment and how faithfully you do the exercises.</p>
