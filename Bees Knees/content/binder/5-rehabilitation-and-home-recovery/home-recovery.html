<h2>Home Recovery</h2>

<li>
<h3>Wound Care</h3>
<p>After you return home, a home health nurse may visit to change your bandage and check your wound, or remove surgical staples if you have them. Talk to your case manager in the hospital about your needs.<br /><br /> Nurses will teach you to care for your incision. Inspect it daily after washing your hands. Wash it with soap and water and lightly pat it dry; do not rub. Keep it covered if it is draining. If there are steri strips (small tapes) across the incision let them fall off on their own at about two weeks; do not pull them off. Keep your incision out of the sun as it can bum easily. Do not use lotions, ointments, or creams until approved by your surgeon. No swimming, hot tubs or baths until your surgeon allows.</p>

<h3>Medication</h3>
<p>People experience differing degrees of pain following total knee replacement. Your physician may give you a prescription for painkillers depending on your tolerance. You may also be given an anti-coagulant or blood-thinning medication (Lovenox, Coumadin or Xarelto), to prevent blood clots in the weeks after surgery.<br /><br /> Lovenox is a blood-thinning agent that is injected. You and a family member will be taught how to administer it before discharge. Expect to use it for 2 to 4 weeks based on surgeon preference and your medical condition.<br /><br /> Coumadin is a blood thinner that is taken by mouth. Dosing is regulated by blood tests drawn one to two times weekly. You will be taking this medication from 4 to 6 weeks. There are dietary concerns and restrictions when using it, and you will be given a Coumadin education packet or Lovenox training kit while in the hospital.<br /><br /> Xarelto is a new blood thinner that is taken by mouth. You will be instructed on blood thinner precautions while in the hospital.<br /><br /> Talk to your physician or pharmacist before taking any drugs or medication if you have questions.</p>

<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>In general, there are no specific diet restrictions following joint replacement. However, eating a well-balanced diet provides your body with the vitamins and nutrients necessary for the healing process. You health care team may recommend calcium and vitamin D supplements to aid bone growth and healing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Stop Smoking</h3>
<p>Smoking interferes with the body 's ability to absorb oxygen and could slow your healing processes . Smoking increases risks for all complications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>Your therapist will teach you how to use the device you will use for walking. Please continue to use this device until instructed otherwise. Walking can help your body function better, prevent complications, improve your mood and speed your recovery.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Bathing</h3>
<p>Many surgeons allow showering 1to 2 days after surgery if the incision is closed and no longer draining. Many incisions are closed with skin glue, which may allow for earlier showering. Please ask your surgeon first. If you have staples, they will be re&shy; moved about I 0 to 14 days after surgery. Water can carry microbes into the staple holes or an open wound putting your re&shy; placement at risk for infection. Therefore, your surgeon may not want you to bathe without covering the incision until these holes heal over; approximately 24 to 48 hours after the staples are removed. Please check with your doctor before showering.<br /><br /> Soaking in a bathtub or hot tub or swimming is NOT recommended for at least 30 days. Please discuss this with your surgeon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Compression or Support Stockings (TED Hose - if ordered)</h3>
<p>Should be worn for at least the first month after surgery, to help prevent blood clots. Remove stockings twice daily and inspect skin. Do not allow them to roll down at the top edge as this will produce a tourniquet effect which will interfere with proper circulation and cause skin breakdown. Hand&shy; wash and air dry socks. A dryer can shrink them. Use assistive devices or get help to apply and remove them.</p>
