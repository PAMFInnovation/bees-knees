<h2>After the Hospital</h2>
<p>One of our goals is to prepare you for a safe transition to home. A number of factors will influence whether you return directly home after your hospital stay and receive home health care or continue your therapy in a more structured setting. Your physician and case manager or social worker will determine which discharge plan is appropriate for you.<br /><br /> Before you go home, equipment may be recommended to help you use the bathroom safely and perform other self-care activities. Some of this equipment may be covered by your insurance plan and will be arranged by your case manager. In addition, your physician may refer nursing and therapy staff from a home care agency to see you at home. Once you are no longer homebound, your physician may recommend outpatient physical therapy to continue your recovery.<br /><br /> If you are unable to go home after the first 3 days of having physical and occupational therapy, you may be transferred to a Skilled Nursing level of care for more rehab services, or if your medical needs are more complex, to the acute rehab unit. Your insurance may or may not authorize a short stay in a SNF or acute rehabilitation facility. Your case manager will help you in making these decisions and subsequent arrangements.<br /><br /> Here you will continue learning how to build strength and endurance, move about safely, and practice your home exercises. You may stay here for a few days or a couple of weeks depending on your progress. Your caregiv&shy; ers will have an opportunity to continue to be trained and to ask questions of the nurses and therapists.</p>
