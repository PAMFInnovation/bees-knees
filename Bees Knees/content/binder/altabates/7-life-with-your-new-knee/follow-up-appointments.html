<h2>Follow-up Appointments</h2>
<p>Your orthopedic surgeon will watch your joint closely as it heals. He or she will continue to check range of motion and strength in your leg several times during the first year after your joint replacement. Anticipate appointments at 6 and 12 weeks with yearly visits after that. Be sure to keep all appointments. It is a good idea to write a list of your questions so you do not forget to ask them at your appointments.</p>
