<body><h2>Surgery</h2>
<p>Approximately 2 hours before your surgery, you will be taken to the Surgery Intake area or Pre-Operative Holding. A friend or family member may be able to remain with you until you proceed to the OR.<br /><br />You will be asked many questions and some questions more than once. This is our system of checks to make sure that we have all the information we need to provide you with the very best care and to keep you safe.<br /><br />An IV will be started before you go to the operating room. An anesthesiologist will greet you and explain anesthesia options available. He/she and a nurse will accompany you to the OR. Your family may wait in the surgical waiting room or in the Family Resource Center. There the surgeon will explain what transpired in surgery and let them know how you are doing. The OR nurse will also keep family updated during the surgery.</p>
