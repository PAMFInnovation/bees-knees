<h2>Post-Hospital Discharge</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Discharge Planning</h3>
<p>The case manager or social worker on the orthopedic unit will work with you to plan your discharge. This may mean home care or plans to transfer you to a SNF that is covered under your insurance plan for short-stay care and rehabilitation, or to the acute rehab program, depending on your needs. If you go directly home, your physician will order the services and the equipment you may need and it will be delivered to you if authorized by the insurance company. Later, outpatient therapy services may be ordered for you to continue your rehabilitation.<br /><br /> If you would like to discuss home care after you are discharged, please call the case management department at 510-869-6160.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Skilled Nursing Facility</h3>
<p>We will make every effort to arrange your transfer to the SNF early on your day of discharge from the hospital to get you settled and so that you have the full course of daily therapy.<br /><br /> Nursing and Rehabilitation staff (physical and occupational therapists) in our SNF will work closely with you to provide the highly skilled coordinated care and rehabilitation to help progress you to your functional goals. Your stay may be from 5 to 10 days, depending on your progress and your medical needs. Your physician will determine your length of stay based on your progress with therapy and nursing care.<br /><br /> As you progress and are close to reaching your functional goals, you will be notified approximately 2 to 3 days prior to your anticipated discharge date, so you and your family can make appropriate discharge plans. The social worker (discharge planner) will assist you in planning for devices, equipment and services that you may need at home. You may qualify for in-home therapy and nursing assistance as well. If necessary, the social worker will coordinate with you and your family for continued long-term care if needed in a community facility.</p>

<h3>Acute Rehabilitation</h3>
<p>Our acute rehabilitation program is a highly structured, intensive, interdisciplinary program intended for patients with significant functional impairments. Our approach provides patients with a supportive, structured and coordinated rehabilitation program designed to improve the ability to perform independent activities of daily living. All patients receive an average of three or more hours of therapy per day, six days per week, depending on their individual goals.<br /><br /> The key to rehabilitation success includes a rehabilitation team that works together with the patient to design an individualized treatment program and establish goals based on the patient's current condition and needs. The team monitors the patient' s progress closely and adjusts the treatment program with the patient to reach these rehabilitation goals. A rehabilitation plan of care is coordinated and carried out 24 hours a day by therapists, nurses, social workers, and physicians. Our dedicated staff of highly skilled professionals specializes in this intense level of rehabilitation.</p>

<h3>Home</h3>
<p>Once you are medically stable and no longer require care in a facility, your doctor will discharge you home. You will be more comfortable in your own environment and home health services will be arranged for you based on physician and therapist recommendation. Home health care generally includes follow-up care by nursing and therapy services. It does not include household tasks such as cleaning, laundry, and mealprep. These services need to beprivately arranged. Your case manager will provide you with a list of resources if needed.</p>

<li>
<h3>Outpatient Therapy</h3>
<p>Your physician may prescribe outpatient physical therapy for you. The timing of this will depend on how mobile you are. The therapist will design an exercise program to improve your walking and increase your mobility. Depending on your needs, the physician and therapist will determine the frequency and duration of your visits.<br /><br /> Regular follow-up and close communication with your physician ensure coordinated care to achieve your therapy goals. Therapy sessions can consist of a combination of individual and group (with other patients recovering from hip surgery).<br /><br /> Our key to your success is that we promote an environment of wellness and teach you how to continue your rehabilitation program at home.</p>
