<h2>After the Hospital</h2>
<p>Our primary goal is to prepare you for a safe transition home. A number of factors will influence whether you return directly home after your hospital stay and receive home health care or continue your therapy in a more structured setting. Your physician, case manager or social worker, and therapist will determine which discharge plan is appropriate for you.<br /><br /> Before you go home, equipment may be recommended to help you use the bathroom safely and perform other self-care activities. Some of this equipment may be covered by your insurance plan and will be arranged by your case manager. In addition, your physician may refer nursing and therapy staff from a home care agency to see you at home. Once you are no longer homebound, your physician may recommend outpatient physical therapy to continue your recovery.<br /><br />  Here you will continue learning how to build strength and endurance, move about safely, and practice your home exercises. You may stay here for a few days or a couple of weeks depending on your progress. Your caregivers will have an opportunity to continue to be trained and to ask questions of the nurses and therapists.</p>
