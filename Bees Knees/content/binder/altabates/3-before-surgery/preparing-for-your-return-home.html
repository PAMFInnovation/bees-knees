<body><h2>Preparing for Your Return Home</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you live alone, make meals ahead of time and freeze, or buy prepared foods that are easy to reheat.</li>
<li>Make plans for helpers to do housework, laundry, meal preparation and pet care.</li>
<li>Rearrange your storage so that things that you use most often are easily accessible. You will want to avoid having to bend down or reach up too much, so put your pots, pans, and clothes in areas that are easily reachable from a standing position.</li>
<li>Move items in the refrigerator from lower shelves to mid level shelves.</li>
<li>Remove and store throw rugs to avoid tripping or catching on a walker or cane.</li>
<li>Clear clutter from your home that may be in the way when walking with a walker.</li>
<li>Move all lamp and phone cords out of your walking path.</li>
<li>Have stable chair(s) with armrests available (rolling office chairs are not suitable).</li>
<li>If your bedroom is on the upper level of your home, create a sleeping area on the first floor if possible for the first couple of weeks.</li>
<li>Check your bed for appropriate height and raise the bed as needed.</li>
<li>Have extra pillows available for appropriate positioning.</li>
<li>Make sure there is a non-skid surface in your tub or shower (i.e., rubber mat or adhesive strips/decals).</li>
<li>Prepare to manage pets that could be a tripping hazard.</li>
<li>Secure handrails on stairs and in shower/tub.</li>
<li>A commode, shower bench and other assistive devices can improve safety in the home.</li>
<li>You will not be able to drive for several weeks after surgery. Arrange to have friends or family help you with errands, grocery shopping or doctor appointments. Get clearance from your orthopedic surgeon before you return to driving.</li>
<li>It is important to stop smoking before surgery. Smoking interferes with the body's ability to absorb oxygen and could slow your healing process.</li>
<li>Plan ahead for methods to prevent constipation. Plan to drink more water; 8 glasses daily (unless your fluids are restricted for medical reasons). Eat plenty of fiber, fruits and vegetables. You may need a stool softener, laxative or even a Fleets enema. You may want to have these available prior to your surgery.</li>
<li>DMV HANDICAPPED PERMIT REGISTRATION Your orthopedic surgeon's office can provide you with an application for a handicapped permit for your use during your recovery and rehabilitation if it is needed. The permit is "prescribed" by your surgeon, so he/she will be signing the application to authorize it. The permit is generally granted for six months.</li>
</ul>
