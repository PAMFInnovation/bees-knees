<body><h2>Understanding Knee Replacement</h2>
<p>A knee joint requiring replacement has significant cartilage wear, possible bone deformity and decreased joint spacing. Movement is no longer pain-free and smooth. Joint stiffness and pain are frequent complaints due to the destruction of the cartilage, caused by injury or inflammation. As the cartilage is worn away, exposed bones rub on each other and cause pain. <br /><br />The x-ray shown here reveals loss of joint space, bony over-growth or spurring and deformity from loss of articular cartilage.<br /><br />The placement of artificial components (joint replacement removes the damaged bony surface and replaces it with metal alloys and special plastics) helps to regain smooth, easy motion and provides greater comfort with movement.</p>
