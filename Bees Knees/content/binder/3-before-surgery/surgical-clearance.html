<body><h2>Surgical Clearance</h2>
<p>Your primary care provider (PCP) will assess your general health and determine if you are healthy enough to undergo elective joint replacement surgery. He or she may order lab tests or other studies in preparation for surgery. You may need to see a specialist such as a cardiologist. These team members will discuss your individual healthcare needs with your orthopedic surgeon and provide written documentation of surgical clearance.</p>
