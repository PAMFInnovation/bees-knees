<body><h2>Dental Work</h2>
<p>Because of the risk of infection that is involved with a joint replacement, any procedure that may increase this risk should be done prior to surgery. Following simple procedures such as dental cleaning or colonoscopy, bacteria and other germs can travel through the bloodstream to your new joint, causing infection there. Gums often bleed during teeth cleanings and invasive dental procedures; any dental work that you need to have done in the near future should be taken care of before surgery. Teeth cleanings can be done up to one week before surgery and invasive dental work up to three weeks prior to surgery.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you wait at least 6 months after your joint replacement to undergo any dental work including teeth cleaning or other invasive procedures such as endoscopy or stenting. Please talk to your surgeon for his or her recommendations. <strong>Please tell all healthcare providers you have an artificial joint and remind them you need antibiotics before any invasive procedures. </strong></p>
