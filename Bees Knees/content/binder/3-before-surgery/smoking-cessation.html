<body><h2>Smoking Cessation</h2>
<p>We encourage you to quit smoking for your health. We have recently gone "tobacco-free" at all of our campuses. This means that smoking is not allowed anywhere on our property, including all indoor areas, balconies, decks, gardens, outdoor areas, and parking garages. <br /> We offer a variety of resources that can help you quit. We've also developed the following information to help you get started and to provide you with the tools you need to quit for good. <br /> Smoking has been associated with a higher incidence of negative surgical outcomes as well as slower healing.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for Quitting</strong></p>
<p>Quitting smoking is a very rewarding decision for you, your family and your friends. To help you begin living your life tobacco free, review the following tips for success:</p>
<ol>
<li>Think about your reasons for quitting. Write them down and carry them with you. Read them every day.</li>
<li>Choose a good time to quit and set a date. Stick with it. Sign a contract. Announce the date to family and friends who support your decision to become tobacco free.</li>
<li>Think about when and why you use tobacco. Do you use tobacco for a pick-me-up? When you're bored? When you're angry, upset or worried? When you're driving? When you're with others who are using tobacco? A couple of weeks before your quit date, wrap your cigarette pack with paper, pencil and rubber band. When you smoke write down the time of day, how you feel and how important that cigarette is to you. This can help you identify your reasons for smoking.</li>
<li>Have a plan before you quit. If you use tobacco for a pick-me-up, plan to exercise or take a walk instead. When you're bored, plan to call a friend, listen to music, or play with your pet. Just get busy! When you're upset, angry or worried, call a friend, write it down or talk to someone you trust.</li>
<li>Think good thoughts. "I will do this.""I'm worth it." "I'm in control." "I'm proud of myself."</li>
<li>What if you smoke after quitting? This does not mean you have to give up. Do something now to get back on track. Don't punish yourself. Think about why you smoked and decide what you will do the next time it comes up. You're still a non-smoker.</li>

<p><strong>Other Information</strong></p>
<p>Talk with your physician, healthcare provider or pharmacist if you have questions or want to discuss alternatives to help you quit smoking, including smoking cessation medication. <br /><br />sutter Health has nicotine replacement therapy available for patients. If you are considering the use of nicotine replacement therapy to reduce withdrawal symptoms as you quit smoking, first ask your doctor if it is a safe option for you. <br /><br /> Nicotine replacement therapy (including prescription medication, patches, gum and lozenges), when combined with group therapy, have been shown to increase the likelihood of quitting.</p>
