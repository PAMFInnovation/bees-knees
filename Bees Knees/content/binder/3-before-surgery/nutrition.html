<body><h2>Nutrition</h2>
<p>Following surgery and while taking pain medication you may experience a decrease in appetite. It is important to eat a nutritious diet to aid in optimal healing. If you find that your appetite has decreased, try to eat smaller meals more often rather than 3 large meals.Make healthy choices including fiber, fruits, vegetables, protein, and calories. Your body requires more calories to heal. Remember to drink plenty of water.</p>

<p>Good nutrition can help give your body strength both before and after surgery. Every change that you make to improve your nutrition before surgery will help your body heal and prepare you for the rehabilitation process. This includes eating foods from all the food groups and taking a multivitamin with minerals daily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calories</strong>
<p>Food provides calories that the body uses for energy. Surgery increases the body's need for calories. Foods that provide energy include carbohydrates like bread, pasta, rice, cereal, fruit, and milk. Fat is another source of energy. Fat is found in oils, spreads, cheese, nuts and meat.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Protein</strong>
<p>Protein is a very important building block for muscle and bone. It is found in meat, fish, eggs, poultry, nuts, dairy products, soy products and cooked dried beans. You should plan to have protein at each meal.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Fiber</strong>
<p>Fiber assists in normal bowel functioning. It can be found in fruits, vegetables, cooked dried beans, dried fruit, and whole grain products. To avoid constipation, you also need to drink enough fluid every day (6 to 8 cups minimum).</p>
</li>
<li><strong><strong>Calcium/strong</strong></strong>
<p>Calcium is an important component of bone. To absorb calcium, your body also needs vitamin D. Calcium can be found in milk products, calcium- fortified foods, some dark green leafy vegetables, and in pill form. It is recommended for men to get 1000 milligrams of calcium a day, and for women to get 1200 milligrams of calcium per day. Your doctor may recommend calcium in pill form for you.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin C</strong>
<p>Vitamin C is important for wound healing and bone formation. It is found in citrus fruits, green and red peppers, collard greens, broccoli, spinach, strawberries, tomatoes and potatoes. If you take a multivitamin, it will contain enough vitamin C.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Here is a sample nutritious meal plan:</h3>
<p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Whole-wheat toast and peanut butter, raisin bran cereal with low fat milk, orange juice.</p>
<p><strong>Lunch:</strong> Turkey sandwich on whole wheat bread with lettuce and tomato, cantaloupe, soy milk.</p>
<p><strong>Dinner:</strong> Grilled steak, baked beans, coleslaw, raw carrot sticks, and iced tea.</p>
<p><strong>Snack:</strong> Fruit yogurt, dried fruit, nuts, and fresh fruit.</p>
<p>You will have a lot to think about after surgery. Don't forget that your food choices will make a difference in your recovery rate. If your appetite is decreased after surgery, ask to speak with a representative of the food service department to discuss menu options.</p>
