<body><h2>Exercise Before Surgery</h2>
<p>One key aspect of planning for your surgery is preparing yourself physically. Strengthening your muscles is important in order to have a speedy recovery. A stronger lower body, for example, will make it easier to stand and walk after surgery. The exercises listed here for the lower body are similar to those that you will be doing after surgery. Your leg will feel very different after surgery. However, it would be beneficial for you to practice the exercises beforehand to familiarize yourself with them.</p>
<p>Strengthening your upper body is also very important. After surgery, your arms are responsible for supporting a great deal of weight that is shifted off the operated joint. A strong upper body will assist with movement in and out of bed, chairs, and when using a walker or crutches.</p>
<p>In addition, overall health plays a clear role in the surgical and recovery process. Therefore, it is recommended that you continue with a walking program. More than strengthening muscle, walking strengthens the heart and circulatory system, making them more able to cope with the stresses that will be put on them from surgery. Before starting a walking program, please consult with your doctor or therapist. Always use any assistive device already prescribed to you and make sure you walk in a safe environment. Gradually increase the time that you walk so that you can walk up to 30 minutes at a time. If you are unable to walk for exercise, consult your physician about other options including water exercise. <em>See the Joint Replacement Resource section for more information.</em></p>
<p>If you have had exercises specifically prescribed to you by a doctor or a therapist, please continue with these exercises. You will be given new exercises specifically prescribed to you by a therapist once you have had your surgery. Please practice and become familiar with the exercises in the back of this educational binder.</p>
