<body><h2>No Eating or Drinking Before Surgery</h2>
<p>The night before surgery, do not eat or drink after midnight. This means NO water, coffee, ice, gum, candy, etc. This is the single most important requirement. If you are instructed to take any medications the day of surgery, take the medication with minimal sips of water. If you eat or drink anything on the morning of surgery, your surgery may be cancelled for your own safety.</p>
