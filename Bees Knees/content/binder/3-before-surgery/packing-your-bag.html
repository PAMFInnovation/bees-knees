<body><h2>Packing Your Bag</h2>
<p>Your final preparation for surgery is preparing your bag for your hospital stay. When choosing what to pack and what to leave at home, there are a few important things to keep in mind. You are not sick but you did have surgery. Often you will feel better if you dress, and freshen up (make-up for women and shaving for men). You may not feel up to it the first day but often will by day two.</p>
