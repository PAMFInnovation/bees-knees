<body><h2>Pre-Operative Appointments</h2>
<p>In the weeks before surgery, you will have two appointments for final preparations: a pre-operative session and an appointment with your orthopedic surgeon. These will be arranged through your surgeon&rsquo;s office staff. Please write down any questions and take the list with you to your appointment.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Your Pre-Operative Session:</h3>
<p>Your pre-operative session will take place at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center South Pavilion located at 3100 Summit Street in Oakland. Your surgeon&rsquo;s office staff will schedule this session for you. It will include nursing intake, medical testing, and an education class. <strong>Please bring your coach and be prepared to spend 3 hours at this appointment.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Orthopedic Surgeon Appointment</h3>
<p>Your surgeon will discuss final plans for surgery and review risks, benefits and possible complications. This is an opportunity to review the procedure and ask final questions before surgery. Please share your medication list with your surgeon. He/she will instruct you on which medications to take and NOT take before your surgery. Some medications such as herbal supplements and anti-inflammatory drugs should be stopped for several days prior to surgery. These medications can thin your blood, and cause unnecessary bleeding, as well as other adverse effects. Talk to your surgeon about ALL medicines you take including herbals, supplements and over- the-counter medicines. Some do not mix well with anesthesia.</p>
