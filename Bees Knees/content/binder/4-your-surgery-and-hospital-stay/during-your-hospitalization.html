<body><h2>During your hospitalization</h2>
<p>You can help by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussing your pain control options with your healthcare provider.</li>
<li>Letting your healthcare providers know as soon as you begin having pain.</li>
<li>Taking your pain medication at regular times. Most pain medication taken by mouth needs at least 20 to 30 minutes to take effect.</li>
<li>Rating your pain using the 1 to 10 pain scale. A 0 on the scale means no pain, and a 10 on the scale means the worst pain you can imagine.</li>
<li>Reporting your pain as a number helps the doctors and nurses know how well your treatment is working and whether or not to make any changes.</li>
</ul>
