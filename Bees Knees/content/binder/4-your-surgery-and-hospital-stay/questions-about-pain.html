<body><h2>Questions About Pain</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Could I become addicted to the pain medication?</strong>
<p>It is rare to become addicted to medicine used for pain control when taken properly.<br /> Addiction means a person is taking a medicine to satisfy emotional or psychological needs rather than for medical reasons. Addiction is often confused with physical dependence. Physical dependence occurs after you have been using a narcotic for prolonged periods of time (more than two weeks). Physical dependence is a chemical change your body undergoes which causes withdraw&shy; al symptoms if the medicine is abruptly stopped. This is a normal response and can be avoided by gradually reducing the medicine over several days. Physical dependence is not addiction.</p>

<li><strong>Could I build up a tolerance to the pain medication so it stops working? </strong>
<p>For some medicines, after a person takes the same amount for a long period of time, the body doesn't respond as well to the same amount. Larger or more frequent doses of medicine are needed to obtain the same effect. This is called "tolerance" and it sometimes happens in people who take narcotics for pain control over a long period of time. This should not be an issue following your surgery, as you will only be taking pain medication for a short period of time.<br /> However if you have taken narcotics for a long period of time prior to joint replacement surgery you will want to discuss this with your surgeon.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>What if I have side effects from the pain medication?</strong>
<p>All drugs have potential side effects. Not everyone who takes a medicine will experience side effects. Some of the more common side effects of prescription pain medications are drowsiness, constipation, and nausea. You should always discuss any side effects with your healthcare provider.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>What if I don't take my pain medication?</strong>
<p>You may not recover as quickly. Pain medication allows you to stay mobile and helps you get the most out of your exercises. Pain causes increased fatigue which also slows recovery. Pain adds stress to yourself and your caregivers.</p>
