<h3>Blood Clots in Legs</h3>
<p>Surgery may cause the blood to slow in the veins of your legs, creating a blood clot. This is why you take blood thinners after surgery. Blood clots can form in either leg.

<ul>
<li>Swelling in the thigh, calf, or ankle that does not go down with elevation</li>

</ul>
<p><br /> Prevention of blood clots:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foot and ankle pump exercises Walking</li>
<li>Compression stockings</li>
<li>Anti-coagulants (blood thinning medications)</li>
<li>Leg elevation</li>
<li>No pillows under knees</li>

<ul>
<li>Sudden chest pain</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing</li>
<li>Sweating</li>
