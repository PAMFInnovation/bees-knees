<h3>Peripheral Nerve Block Information Sheet - Lumbar Plexus Nerve Block For Hip and Knee Replacement Surgery</h3>
<p>Your surgeon and anesthesiology pain management team have determined that continuous peripheral nerve block is an option following your surgical procedure. The following information is provided to introduce you to the concept of peripheral nerve blocks.<br /><br /> Lumbar Plexus Nerve Block is one option for sustained postoperative pain relief for hip, knee and upper leg surgery.<br /><br /> After numbing the skin on the lower back, a plastic catheter is placed adjacent to the lumbar plexus (the nerves innervating your hip, thigh and knee). The catheter is connected to a pump that coats the nerves with local anesthetic and blocks painful sensation from the hip, knee and thigh region.<br /><br />This provides significant total pain relief after extensive hip, knee or thigh surgical procedures. It can be especially helpful for total hip replacement. Potential health benefits inclue decreased need for systemic/intravenous and oral ("by mouth") pain medication, less post-operative sedation, decreased likelihood of post-operative nausea and vomiting, and possible earlier discharge home.<br /><br />Numbness of hip, thigh, or knee usually lasts 6 to 8 hours after the catheter infusion is discontinued. It is important to start your oral pain medication prior to resolution of the numbness. This will allow for a smooth transition from pain relief supplied by the catheter to pain relief supplied by an oral pain medication.<br /><br /> Risks may include inadequate pain relief, bleeding, infection, reaction to local anesthetic, or nerve injury. Kinking of the catheter tubing and inadvertent discontinuation of the catheter can also occur. Please discuss any concerns with your anesthesiologist.<br /><br /> Please keep the operative hip/leg well protected for the duration of the numbness. Walk only with assistance or crutches since leg strength may be reduced until the block wears off.<br /><br /> The peripheral nerve block is offered as an optional addition to the main anesthetic. Please discuss all concerns regarding this procedure and anesthetic care with your anesthesiologist on the day of surgery. The above information is not intended as a substitute for a complete discussion with your anesthesiologist. Itis intended for your education and to enhance your ability to ask informed questions.</p>
<h3>Peripheral Nerve Block Information Sheet -Femoral Nerve Block</h3>
<p>Your surgeon and anesthesiology pain management team have determined that continuous peripheral nerve block is an option following your surgical procedure. The following information is provided to introduce you to the concept of peripheral nerve blocks.<br /><br /> Femoral Nerve Catheter is one option for sustained postoperative pain relief for knee and upper leg surgery.<br /><br /> After numbing the skin of the upper thigh, a plastic catheter is placed adjacent to the femoral nerve. The catheter is connected to a pump that coats the nerve with local anesthetic and blocks painful sensation from the knee and thigh region.<br /><br /> This provides significant total pain relief after extensive knee or thigh surgical procedures. It can be especially helpful for total knee replacement surgery and anterior cruciate ligament repairs. Potential benefits include decreased need for systemic/intravenous and oral ("by mouth") pain medication, less post-operative sedation, decreased likelihood of post-operative nausea and vomiting, and possible earlier discharge home.<br /><br /> Numbness of thigh and knee usually lasts 6 to 8 hours after the catheter infusion is discontinued. It is important to start your oral pain medication prior to resolution of the numbness. This will allow for a smooth transition from pain relief supplied by the catheter to pain relief supplied by an oral pain medication. For total knee replacement surgery, it is normal to feel mild to significant discomfort from the back of the knee for the first 24 to 36 hours, since this area is innervated by the sciatic nerve which does not get bathed in local anesthetics.<br /><br /> Possible risks include inadequate pain relief, bleeding, infection, reaction to local anesthetic, and nerve injury. Kinking of the catheter tubing and inadvertent discontinuation of the catheter can also occur. Please discuss any concerns with your anesthesiologist.<br /><br /> Please keep the operative leg well protected for the duration of the numbness.
