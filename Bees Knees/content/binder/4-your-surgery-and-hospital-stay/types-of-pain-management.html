<body><h2>Types of Pain Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>A PCA (patient controlled analgesia) is a form of pain control delivered through your IV via a monitoring device. You are able to push a button to deliver a specified dose of medication that will work quickly. Usually pain relief is experienced within minutes. The PCA is programmed according to your physician' s orders. It will only allow the dose prescribed at a preset rate. The nursing staff will be monitoring you frequently for the effectiveness of the medication.</li>
<li>A pain pump may be inserted at or near the surgical site during surgery by the surgeon. A small dose is trickled to the surgical site and the patient can press a button to receive a dose at set intervals. Typically this pump can be used for 1 to 2 days post operatively.</li>
<li>A nerve block may be used. The anesthesiologists will discuss options and help you determine what is best for you. The anesthesiologist administers the nerve block prior to surgery. It can last from 12 to 18 hours post-operatively when used as a single injection. When used as a continuous block it can be effective for approximately 2 days. Some persons experience a mild burning type sensation in the extremity as it wears off. <strong>Please be sure you ask for assistance by nursing or therapy when you need to get out of bed. Your leg will NOT function normally and will not support you.</strong> Often persons feel pain at the back of their knee. The pathway of the block does not cover this area. Please let your nurse know if you experience pain.</li>
<li>Intra-articular joint injections may also be used. They are injected into the joint capsule prior to implantation of the new joint. They often provide pain relief for 12 or more hours. If you receive an intra-articular injection, your leg will feel as though it was "asleep." This method is often used on at least one extremity when both knee joints are done simultaneously.</li>
<li>Oral medication is prescribed by your physician and will also be administered by the nursing staff. Anticipate taking oral medications 30 to 60 minutes before therapy sessions to get the best pain relief and to fully participate in each therapy session.</li>
<li>Non-medicine methods of pain control are also very effective. These mezthods include; deep breathing exercises, guided imagery, ice or heat, repositioning, relaxation techniques, acupuncture or acupressure, meditation, music, massage, or diversional activities such as reading or watching a favorite movie. Please consider trying some of these methods before coming to the hospital.</li>
