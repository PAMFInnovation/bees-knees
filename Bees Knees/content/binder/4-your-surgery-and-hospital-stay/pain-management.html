<body><h2>Pain Management</h2>
<p>Pain control is very important to maximize your ability to participate in therapy and perform your daily activities following your surgery. Some pain after surgery is quite common and can be controlled. Various forms of pain management can be administered in pill form, by injection, or through your IV.</p>
<p><em>Pain Scale</em></p>

<p>Your nurses will continue to ask you to rate your pain using the scale below. It is important to tell your nurse or a member of your care team if your pain is worsening. Rate your pain with 0 being no pain and 10 as the worst pain. This will help you and your care team know if your medication is working and how it is managing your pain most effectively. <br /> It is very important to stay ahead of pain and take medication proactively or before pain becomes severe.</p>
