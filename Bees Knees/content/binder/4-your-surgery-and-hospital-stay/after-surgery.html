<body><h2>After Surgery</h2>
<p>After your procedure, you will be taken to the recovery room or Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). You will have an IV in your arm, a urinary catheter in your bladder, and a dressing with ice pack or machine on the surgical wound. A wound drain may be present also.<br /><br />TED (support) hose and/or Sequential Compression Devices (SCD) will be on your legs. The SCDs intermittently fill with air and gently squeeze your legs to prevent blood from pooling in your legs and potentially causing clots. You will have a knee immobilizer (a de&shy; vice that will not allow bending of your knee) on your surgical knee when you're walking.<br /><br />During your stay in the recovery room, you will be closely observed and monitored. The nurse will check your blood pressure, pulse and respirations every 15 minutes or more as needed. Surgical dressings, drainage tubes and intravenous lines will be observed.</p>

<p>While in the recovery room, you will be encouraged to take deep breaths. You will receive oxygen to keep your blood oxygen level up while you wake up. You may feel very relaxed or slightly groggy immediately following your procedure . If you have any discomfort, ask your nurse for assistance. Medication is available to help reduce any pain or discomfort you may experience after surgery. Nurses will ask you to move your ankles, take deep breaths and cough to clear your lungs.<br /> Following regional anesthesia, which may include spinals, epidurals or blocks, you will feel numbness and tingling in your operative leg. You may not be able to move your affected leg for a short time. During that time, you will be monitored and measures will be taken to en&shy; sure you are comfortable and safe.</p>
<h3>The Orthopedic Floor</h3>
<p>You may stay 2 to 3 days on the orthopedic specialty unit. This is where you will be recovering from surgery. You will have an IV at first but you will quickly progress to eating and drinking and it will be removed. Physical and occupational therapists and nurses will help you sit, get out of bed, learn to dress, and walk for the first time. You should request pain medication frequently enough to be sure that you can participate well in therapy and accomplish these activities with reasonable comfort.</p>
