<h2>How to Use an Incentive Spirometer</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Deep breathing exercises with your incentive spirometer (breathing exerciser) will help open the air sacs in your lungs and may reduce future problems such as pneumonia. You can use this incentive spirometer on your own and take an active part in your recovery!</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>You may need to put the spirometer together. If so, attach the open end of the clear tubing to the port or opening at the bottom of the incentive spirometer. The mouthpiece is at the other end of the tubing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold the incentive spirometer upright.</li>
<li>Breathe out normally, close your lips tightly around the mouthpiece and inhale slowly and deeply through your mouth. This slow deep breath will raise the piston in the clear chamber of the spirometer. This is similar to trying to suck a thick milkshake through a straw.
<ul>
<li>It is important to breathe in slowly to allow the air sacs in your lungs time to open.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continue to breathe in, trying to raise the piston as high as you can. Read the volume that you have achieved at the top of the piston.
<ul>
<li>Each day you use your incentive spirometer you should see improvement in how deep a breath you can take. This may make you cough, which is normal. It will help to open up your lungs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When you feel like you cannot breathe in any longer, take the mouthpiece out of your mouth. Hold your breath for 3 to 5 seconds then breathe out slowly.</li>
<li>Breathe normally for a few breaths and let the piston return to the bottom of the chamber.</li>
<li>Set the goal indicator tab at the level that you reached.</li>
<li>Repeat the slow, deep breath in and slow breath out again. Continue this cycle for a total of 10 breaths. If you start to feel lightheaded or dizzy, slow your breathing down and give yourself more time with normal size breaths between the deep breaths.</li>
<li>After you have taken 10 deep breaths on your incentive spirometer, it is important to cough to try to remove secretions that build up in your lungs.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 through 8, every 1 hour, or as ordered by your doctor.</li>
  </ul></ul>
<p><strong>Keep the incentive spirometer within reach so you will remember to use it frequently. To help remember to use it every hour, some patients use their incentive spirometer at the commercial breaks between TV shows.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using your spirometer frequently while you are recovering at home will help keep your lungs clear.</li>
